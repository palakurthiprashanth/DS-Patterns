/**
Given an array of numbers which is sorted in ascending order and is rotated ‘k’ times around a pivot, find ‘k’.

You can assume that the array does not have any duplicates.

Example 1:

Input: [10, 15, 1, 3, 8]
Output: 2
Explanation: The array has been rotated 2 times.
**/



It is same as Find pivot element in a sorted array , where we finfd the smallest value in rotated array , index of smallest value is which count of rotations,
In above example , index of smallest value is 2, hence count is 2.
